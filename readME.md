As mentionned in the description the point of this project is to develop for the fun of it while offering an API for MGS series enthusiasts.
The first goal is to : give a random mgs recruit codename to anyone wanting one

## IMPROVMENT Ideas :

1. POST new name suggestion endpoint :

this endpoint will allow anyone to post a new codename (first name or last name or both), this codename will then go through a verification and in the end will populate the db

2. Additionnal random infos for the recruit :

Codenames are great but what about some titles (BOSS, BIG BOSS, etc.. ) ? life stats ? some being rarest than others

3. AI Generate picture of recruit :

Prompting an AI to generate a mgs:peacewalker style picture of the recruit and sending it to the client

4. Website :

would be nice to have a website for the front end that will allow to generate recruits and build your own motherbase (whole new project/repo)
