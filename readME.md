As mentionned in the description the point of this project is to develop for the fun of it while offering an API for MGS series enthusiasts.
The first goal is to : give a random mgs recruit codename to anyone wanting one

## IMPROVMENT Ideas :

1. POST new name suggestion endpoint :

this endpoint will allow anyone to post a new codename (first name or last name or both), this codename will then go through a verification and in the end will populate the db

2. Putting up swagger on this bitch

3. Endpoint where people can propose their own codenames adjectives / nouns so that the pool of randomly chosed names becomes better

4. Support profile picture in a mgs:PW style for each users / recruits

## Connection with MGS-Motherbase

Now this api endpoint will also serve as a user database for the myDigitalSchool project "mgs-motherbase" the two of them combined will create a user experience in the theme of metal gear solid motherbase managemement
